# Customer Purchase Prediction Model
## Overview
This project is aimed at building a machine learning model that can predict customer purchases over the next four months based on their purchasing history over the previous three months. The main goal is to help our client's business optimize their inventory management and marketing strategy by accurately predicting customer behavior.

## Data Description
The dataset used for this project consisted of customer purchase history over a period of three months. It included various features such as the customer ID, the product category, and the purchase date.

## Methodology
The project involved the following steps:

1. [Data exploration and analysis](#data-exploration-and-preprocessing)
2. [Data preprocessing and cleaning](#data-exploration-and-preprocessing)
3. [Model selection and training](#model-building)
4. [Model evaluation and refinement](#model-evaluation)

## Data exploration and Preprocessing
The first step in this project was to explore and analyze the data to identify any patterns and trends that could be used to build the predictive model. After that, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing to remove any errors or outliers that could negatively impact the accuracy of the model. I also transformed the data to make it more suitable for machine learning algorithms, such as one-hot encoding and normalization.

## Model Building
I experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest multi-label classifiers. After extensive testing and analysis, I settled on a random forest multi-label classifier as the most effective for predicting customer purchases.

## Model Evaluation
The model achieved an impressive accuracy of over 90%. I used various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure that the model is robust and reliable.
